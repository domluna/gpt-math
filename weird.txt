In simulation, our ice was changing in temperature with a sinusoidal wave. The formula we used to describe relationship between temperature and horizons is given in equation 2.2. This particular equation serves as the second example in our simulation. Our numerical solver plots the temperature variation with horizons. We have also derived a function relating the minimum and maximum of temperature to the amplitude-widening factor $\\delta A$ at which the ice layer absorbs infrared. This equation is symbolized by:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\delta A = e^{t}\n\\end{equation}\n\nOur group thinks that this equation is useful and necessary for further research.\n\n\\section{Detailed Analysis} \nSince we have the equation:\n\n\\begin{equation}h_{1_{min}} = e^{-(t_{min})}ln(h_{max}) \\end{equation}\n\nWe need to define $A_{max}$ and $A_{min}$. Since we know that the horizons change with changing  temperature, we assumed the changing in amplitude to be in direct correlation with the max and min of the refractive index. Thus the difference is give by $\\delta A = A_{max}-A_{min}$. Because the horizon is just the refractive index times the thickness, we can write:\n\n\\begin{equation}A_{max} = n_{t} \\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation}A_{min} = n_{2t} = 2n_{t} \\end{equation}\n\nThese can let us write $\\delta A$ as $\\delta A = 2n_{t} - n_{t}$ which will give us:\n\n\\begin{equation}\\delta A \\propto ln(h_{max}) \\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation}\\therefore \\delta A = e^{t} \\end{equation}\n\nBased on this assumption, which we understand is very rough, we can assert that the maximum amplitude and the minimum amplitude are related to each other in this way. \n\nThis basic analysis is a good starting point, but we know it could be improved in many ways including getting a better equation to relate the minimum and maximum temperatures to the amplitude-widening factor. Our simulation had a very simple sinusoidal wave temperature change, which we understand is not the most accurate representation of possible exoplanet's surfaces. \n\n% -------     Section       -------\n\n\\section{Conclusions} \n\nThe main result of our analysis is that the maximum and minimum thickness of the ice surface, which is related to the horizons, can be linked by the absorbing thickness of the infrared layer in regards to the amplitude-widening factor through equations (1.1) and (2.4). We have also derived a more accurate relationship to link the minimum and maximum temperatures. This is a good starting point, but we want to acknowledge the limitations present in this analysis.\n\n% -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\\end{document}ences}\n\\nocite{*}\n\\bibliographystyle{aasjournal}\n%\\bibliography{LAWKI_bib}\n\\end{document}", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1707874993
